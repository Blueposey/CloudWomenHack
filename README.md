**Project Overview**:
   - A brief summary of the project, its objectives, and the problem it aims to solve.

The Nourish Network is a simple application that assists organizations tackling food waste such as food banks and mutual aid organizations by using AI to connect them with areas of food surplus on demand. Our idea was born out of the desire to make an impact on the 120 billion pounds of food The United States discards — every year. At the same time nearly 35 million people across America — including 10 million children — suffer from food insecurity.
Our project will not handle to logistics of transportation, consumer outreach, or public data disclosure, our proposed goal with the Nourish Network is to streamline connections between organizatitons that handle food excess with food retailers, farmers, and wholesalers.
