## Introduction 
Animal agriculture is responsible for 16.5% of all global greenhouse emissions and 77% of the world’s agricultural land is used for animal agriculture and growing. The United States discards 120 billion pounds of food — every year. At the same time nearly 35 million people across America — including 10 million children — suffer from food insecurity. Animal farming puts a strain on our soil further reducing our planet’s ability to recuperate from climate disasters, making food access increasingly insecure fueling a vicious cycle. Our project addresses food waste by using AI to connect food banks and mutual aid organizations with food retailers, wholesalers, and farmers; enabling organizations working to revolutize food sharing by leveraging AI to resolve some of the logistical and adminstrative barriers.
