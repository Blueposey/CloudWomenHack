## Introduction 
Animal agriculture is responsible for 16.5% of all global greenhouse emissions and 77% of the world’s agricultural land is used for animal agriculture and growing. The United States discards 120 billion pounds of food — every year. At the same time nearly 35 million people across America — including 10 million children — suffer from food insecurity. Animal farming puts a strain on our soil further reducing our planet’s ability to recuperate from climate disasters, making food access increasingly insecure fueling a vicious cycle. Our project addresses food waste by using AI to connect food banks and mutual aid organizations with food retailers, wholesalers, and farmers; enabling organizations working to revolutize food sharing by leveraging AI to resolve some of the logistical and adminstrative barriers.

## Next Steps 
Project Steps

- Data Collection: Gather data from various sources, including food retailers, wholesalers, farmers, and food banks. This could include information on food types, availability, shelf life, and demand patterns.

-Data Preparation: Clean and preprocess the data using Azure Data Factory, Document Intelligence or within AzureML to ensure it is ready for modeling.

-Model Development: Use Azure ML to create and train models. Focus on models that can predict food availability, optimize logistics, and identify food surplus.

-Integration: Use Azure Functions and Logic Apps to integrate various components of your system. Ensure that food banks can easily access information about available food.

-Deployment
Deploy your model and system using Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) or Azure App Service, ensuring scalability and reliability.

-Monitoring and Improvement
Set up monitoring to track the performance of your models and workflows. Use Azure Monitor and Application Insights for this purpose. Iterate on your models based on real-world data and feedback.
